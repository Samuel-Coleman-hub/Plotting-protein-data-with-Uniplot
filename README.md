Description
-----------------
This purpose of this program is to analyse a taxonomy of proteins across different
species. It has the functionality to print out a list of the proteins in the taxonomy,
show the average length of the proteins and create a graph to show the average length of different
proteins.


How to use
-----------------
To use this program you will need to enter specific commands into the terminal.
```
"pipenv run python uniplot.py dump"
```
This will allow you to print out an unformatted list of all the proteins.
```
"pipenv run python uniplot.py list"
```
This will allow you to print out a formatted list of all the proteins.
```
"pipenv run python uniplot.py average"
```
This will print out the average length of the proteins.
```
"pipenv run python uniplot.py plot-average-by-taxa"
```
This will plot a graph showing the average protein length by taxonomy.
